## 🧮 Tools & Libraries

These experiments use **Python** and standard scientific libraries:

- `NumPy` — numerical computation  
- `SciPy` — signal processing  
- `Matplotlib` — visualization  
- `librosa` (optional) — audio I/O and spectrogram tools  
- `sms-tools` — sinusoidal and harmonic model implementation (from UPF/MTG course)

## 🚀 Learning Goals

Through these mini-projects, I aim to:
- Understand and implement **core DSP blocks** (filters, transforms, models).
- Develop **intuition about frequency-domain behavior** and time-resolution trade-offs.
- Prepare for **embedded implementation** (C/C++ on ESP32 or ARM Cortex-M).
