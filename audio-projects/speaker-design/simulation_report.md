# Simulation Report â€” 3-Way Loudspeaker Design

## 1. Objective
This document presents the **simulation and crossover design** results for the 3-way loudspeaker project.  
All simulations were performed using **VituixCAD**, with individual driver responses imported from manufacturer data and adjusted for real baffle placement and diffraction.

The goal is to achieve a **flat, coherent, and phase-aligned frequency response** within the design constraints.
