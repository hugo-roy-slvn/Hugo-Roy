# Enclosure Design & Simulation â€” 3-Way Loudspeaker Project

## 1. Objective

The goal of this section is to **design and simulate** both the **enclosure geometry** and the **crossover network** to achieve the desired **acoustic balance**, **frequency response**, and **mechanical stability**.

The enclosure design includes a **bass-reflex** configuration for the woofer and **sealed sub-enclosures** for the midrange and tweeter.  
The crossover network is **simulated and optimized in VituixCAD** to ensure smooth driver integration, accurate phase alignment, and a natural tonal balance.

## 2. General Enclosure Concept

| Band | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|
| **Woofer** | Bass-reflex (ported) | Extend low-frequency response and reduce cone excursion. |
| **Midrange** | Sealed sub-enclosure | Isolate from woofer pressure and stabilize the midband. |
| **Tweeter** | Closed back / integrated | Natural mechanical damping of dome driver. |

## 3. Design Parameters

### 3.1 Woofer Enclosure

| Parameter | Symbol | Target / Measured | Unit |
|------------|---------|-------------------|------|
| Equivalent compliance volume | \( V \) | [__39__] | L |
| Resonance frequency | \( f_s \) | [_33_Hz__] | Hz |
| Total Q factor | \( Q \) | [4,9] | â€“ |
| Enclosure internal volume | \( V_b \) | [_42__] | L |


### 3.2 Midrange Sub-Enclosure

| Parameter | Target Value | Comment |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| Internal volume | [_5_L__] | Minimized to prevent LF resonance. |
| Wall damping | polyester wool | Reduces internal reflections. |
| Isolation | âœ… Separate from woofer chamber | Prevents pressure modulation. |
| Resonant frequency | > [_85_Hz__] |  |
| Enclosure internal volume | \( V_b \) | [5] L  |  |

The simulated SPL response shows a dip around 50 Hz, which is expected to be compensated by the contribution of the bass reflex port. The impedance curve remains satisfactory, consistently above 5 Î©. Phase alignment was challenging to fine-tune, so it was left as currently modeled, with the final evaluation to be performed through listening tests.

## 7. Summary and Next Steps

| Next Step | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| ðŸ”¹ Measure frequency response with REW | Validate simulated  response. |
| ðŸ”¹ Adjust damping and port tuning | Refine transient balance and reduce resonance. |
