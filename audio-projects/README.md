Welcome to my personal collection of **audio projects**, developed as part of my continuous learning in **digital signal processing (DSP)**, **audio electronics**, and **embedded systems**.

These projects are primarily **educational and exploratory**, designed to help me deepen my technical understanding of sound, signal processing, and embedded implementation — bridging the gap between theory, code, and perception.

General Objectives :

- Develop a strong understanding of **audio signal processing principles**, both in simulation (Python) and in real-time (ESP32,...).  
- Explore the **complete audio chain** — from signal capture to playback.  
- Gain hands-on experience in **filter design, DSP algorithms**, and **embedded audio systems**.  
- Apply my background in **embedded systems engineering** to the field of **sound design and audio technology**.

"Sound is where science meets perception." These projects are my way of exploring that connection.
