# ESP32 Audio Loopback with IIR Filter and Switch Control

**Goal:** Implement and demonstrate a real-time **IIR (Infinite Impulse Response)** audio filter on an ESP32 microcontroller using the IÂ²S interface.  
- **Language:** C (ESP-IDF)  
- **Key concepts:** digital filtering, real-time audio pipeline, IÂ²S audio interface  
- **Hardware:** NMP441 microphone + ESP32 +  MAX98357A amplifier + passive speaker   
- **Educational purpose:** understand computational constraints and latency in embedded DSP.

## Overview

This project implements a **real-time audio loopback** on the **ESP32**, with:
- **Microphone input (IÂ²S RX)**
- **Amplifier output (IÂ²S TX)**
- **Optional IIR low-pass filter** (toggleable via a physical button)

It is designed as a **modular and maintainable firmware**, showcasing:
- Real-time audio processing pipeline (16 kHz)
- DSP implementation of a biquad IIR filter (Direct Form I)
- Separation of hardware abstraction (IÂ²S) and DSP logic
- GPIO switch interrupt-based control

This structure makes it a base for embedded audio experiments:
EQs, filters, crossovers, and DSP demonstrations.

- Configurable **IIR low-pass filter (Butterworth 2áµ‰ ordre)**  
- Real-time enable/disable via **GPIO button (BOOT)**  
- Modular design for easy extension  
- ESP-IDF compatible (v5.x)

## Python Validation (stability & frequency response)

This project includes two small Python utilities to **validate the IIR filter design** and **inspect its response** before flashing the firmware.  
Those files can be found in DSP_tools repository.

### IIR_stability_analyser.py - pole/zero check & stability plot
- Computes zeros/poles from your coefficients
- Verifies stability (all poles strictly inside the unit circle)
- Draws a Z-plane diagram (poles/zeros + unit circle)

### IIR_coef_filer_calculator.py - coefficient "cookbook" + Bode plots
- Provides biquad generator functions (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, peaking)
- Returns normalized coefficients [b0,b1,b2], [1,a1,a2]
- Plots magnitude (dB) and phase for quick inspection

### dependancies
~~~bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib

## Performance Analysis

The ESP32 implementation achieves **stable real-time audio processing** with an extremely low and consistent latency between the microphone input and the speaker output.

### Processing Load

Real-time performance was measured using `esp_timer_get_time()` around the main processing loop  
(`i2s_channel_read()` â†’ IIR filter â†’ `i2s_channel_write()`).


At 16 kHz and a DMA frame size of **128 samples**:
- Each block represents **8 ms of audio**.  
- The measured processing time of **7.80 ms** means the ESP32 processes each audio block **just within the real-time window**, achieving a near 100 % real-time rate with minimal buffer latency.

### Estimated End-to-End Latency

The total latency of the audio path combines:
- RX DMA buffering (128 samples â†’ 8 ms)  
- Processing (measured â‰ˆ 7.8 ms)  
- TX DMA buffering (128 samples â†’ 8 ms)

**Total estimated latency â‰ˆ** 8 + 7.8 + 8 =  23.8 ms

This corresponds to a **real-world latency of ~24 ms**,  
which is **inaudible to the human ear** and comparable to professional-grade low-latency monitoring systems.

### ðŸ”¹ Stability

With the configuration  
`dma_frame_num = 128` and `dma_desc_num = 3`:
- The system maintains **continuous audio without underruns or overruns**.  
- Audio propagation feels **instantaneous** during live use.

## Possible Extensiosn
- Add FIR filtering (e.g., convolution EQ)
- Implement multi-band parametric EQ
- Add FFT-based visualization or spectral analysis
- Add IIR filter design function configurable via UART or web interface
- Switch between low-pass / high-pass / bypass
